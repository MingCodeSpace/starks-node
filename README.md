# Starks Network

## Introduction

The Starks Network aims to enrich the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem with zero-knowledge proof technology. It can bring [zk-STARK](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/11/09/starks_part_1.html) proof generation/verification capability to general purpose computations. The Starks Network can enable a wide range of applications from data privacy protection to novel DeFi infrastructures. 

The Starks Node is built upon the the [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) blockchain framework. At its core, it uses the [Distaff VM](https://github.com/GuildOfWeavers/distaff), a zk-STARK virtual machine, for STARK proof generation and verification. In the future, the Starks Network will become a parachain/parathread in Polkadot/Kusama and serve all other chains in the network via cross-chain communications.
